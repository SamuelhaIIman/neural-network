# Neural Networks in Pure Python

This project is a simple implementation of a neural network using **only Python and NumPy**. The goal is to understand the inner workings of a neural network by building it from scratch without using any deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

---

## Project Goals

- To create a functional neural network using only Python and NumPy.
- To understand the core concepts of neural networks:
  - **Feedforward propagation**
  - **Weighted sums**
  - **Activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid)**
- To experiment with multi-neuron and multi-layer architectures.
- To provide a stepping stone for learning advanced concepts like backpropagation and training.
